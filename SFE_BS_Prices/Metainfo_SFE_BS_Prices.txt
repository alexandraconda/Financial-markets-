Input: S      = 100       # stock price
       K      = 100       # strike price
       r      = 0.1       # risk free interest rate
       tau    = 0.6       # time to maturity (green line)
       tau2   = 0.003     # time to maturity (red line)
       sigma  = 0.15      # volatility of first plot
       sigma2 = 0.3       # volatility of second plot
       lb     = 0         # lower limit of x axis 
       ub     = 170       # upper limit of x axis
       
Output: Plot of the Call Black-Scholes price as a function of a Brownian Motion St

Example: The first plot (left) is generated for the parameters: S=100, K=100, r=0.1, tau=0.6/tau=0.03 and sigma = 0.15 

         The second plot (right) is generated for the parameters: S=100, K=100, r=0.1, tau=0.6/tau=0.03 and sigma = 0.3
